# Shell Scripting With Examples

Shell Scripting helps automate repetitive tasks. For example, we can simply write the script to clode 1000 repositories. And the we also have the added advantage of using it again when the need arises.

## Introduction to Shell and User Input


### Variables

BASH allows you to define and work with variables. Variables can store data of various types by using the `=` sign. And to access their value later on you call the variable preceeded by the `$` sign.


### Control Flow

Bash provides control flow statements like `if-else`, `for loops`, `while loops`, and `case statements` to control the flow of execution in your scripts. These statements allow you to make decisions, iterate ove lists, and execute different commands based on conditions.
```
#!/bin/bash

# Example script to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero

read -p "Enter a number: " num

if [ $num -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "The number is positive."
elif [ $num -lt 0 ]; then
    echo "The number is negative."
else
    echo "The number is zero."
fi
```

```
#!/bin/bash

# Example script to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop

for (( i=1; i<=5; i++ ))
do
    echo $i
done
```
### Command Substitution

This allows you to capture the output of a command aand use it asa value within your script. You can use backtick or the `$()` syntax.

``current_date=`date +%Y-%m-%d``

`current_date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`

`echo "Enter your name:" read name`

`echo "Hello World"`

`echo "hello world" > index.txt`

`grep "pattern" < input.txt`

`echo "hello world" | grep "pattern"`


### Functions

Bash allows you to  define and use functions to group related commands together. Functions provide a way to modularize your code and make it more reusable. You can define functions using the function keyword or simply by declaring the function name followed by parentheses.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function to greet the user
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1! Nice to meet you."
}

# Call the greet function and pass the name as an argument
greet "John"
```

![Alt text](<Images/Screenshot (100).png>)

For the next commands, I write and run the following Shell Scripts

#### User Input

```
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for their name
echo "Enter your name:"
read name

# Display a greeting with the entered name
echo "Hello, $name! Nice to meet you."
```

#### Directory Manipulation and Navigation

```
#!/bin/bash

# Display current directory
echo "Current directory: $PWD"

# Create a new directory
echo "Creating a new directory..."
mkdir my_directory
echo "New directory created."

# Change to the new directory
echo "Changing to the new directory..."
cd my_directory
echo "Current directory: $PWD"

# Create some files
echo "Creating files..."
touch file1.txt
touch file2.txt
echo "Files created."

# List the files in the current directory
echo "Files in the current directory:"
ls

# Move one level up
echo "Moving one level up..."
cd ..
echo "Current directory: $PWD"

# Remove the new directory and its contents
echo "Removing the new directory..."
rm -rf my_directory
echo "Directory removed."

# List the files in the current directory again
echo "Files in the current directory:"
ls
```

#### File Operations and Sorting

```
#!/bin/bash

# Create three files
echo "Creating files..."
echo "This is file3." > file3.txt
echo "This is file1." > file1.txt
echo "This is file2." > file2.txt
echo "Files created."

# Display the files in their current order
echo "Files in their current order:"
ls

# Sort the files alphabetically
echo "Sorting files alphabetically..."
ls | sort > sorted_files.txt
echo "Files sorted."

# Display the sorted files
echo "Sorted files:"
cat sorted_files.txt

# Remove the original files
echo "Removing original files..."
rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
echo "Original files removed."

# Rename the sorted file to a more descriptive name
echo "Renaming sorted file..."
mv sorted_files.txt sorted_files_sorted_alphabetically.txt
echo "File renamed."

# Display the final sorted file
echo "Final sorted file:"
cat sorted_files_sorted_alphabetically.txt
```

#### Working with Numbers and Calculations

```
#!/bin/bash

# Define two variables with numeric values
num1=10
num2=5

# Perform basic arithmetic operations
sum=$((num1 + num2))
difference=$((num1 - num2))
product=$((num1 * num2))
quotient=$((num1 / num2))
remainder=$((num1 % num2))

# Display the results
echo "Number 1: $num1"
echo "Number 2: $num2"
echo "Sum: $sum"
echo "Difference: $difference"
echo "Product: $product"
echo "Quotient: $quotient"
echo "Remainder: $remainder"

# Perform some more complex calculations
power_of_2=$((num1 ** 2))
square_root=$(echo "sqrt($num2)" | bc)

# Display the results
echo "Number 1 raised to the power of 2: $power_of_2"
echo "Square root of number 2: $square_root"
```


#### File Backup and Timestamping

```
#!/bin/bash

# Define the source directory and backup directory
source_dir="/path/to/source_directory"
backup_dir="/path/to/backup_directory"

# Create a timestamp with the current date and time
timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")

# Create a backup directory with the timestamp
backup_dir_with_timestamp="$backup_dir/backup_$timestamp"

# Create the backup directory
mkdir -p "$backup_dir_with_timestamp"

# Copy all files from the source directory to the backup directory
cp -r "$source_dir"/* "$backup_dir_with_timestamp"

# Display a message indicating the backup process is complete
echo "Backup completed. Files copied to: $backup_dir_with_timestamp"
```
